# Sudoku Solver  
  
I've always wanted to finish all of the sudoku's in Brain Age, but there are so many of them, and I just don't break out the (3)DS like I used to. Today, I powered it up and finished one that I didn't remember starting. In all, the intermediate sudoku took me 45 minutes to complete. That's a solid chunk of time, so I figure if I just write a sudoku solver, that's a good stand-in for finishing all the ones in Brain Age. _(Which I do still want to do, some day).  
  
I'm writing this without looking into the existing works, of which I'm sure there are many.
